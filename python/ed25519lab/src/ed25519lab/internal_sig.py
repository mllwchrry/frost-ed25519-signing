"""The internal signature scheme used by PoP and CertEq.

This REPLACES secp256k1lab's schnorr_sign / schnorr_verify (BIP340). The rename
is deliberate and load-bearing: this is a different scheme, and the old name
would invite using it as a general-purpose signer, which it must never be.

WHY IT IS NOT A REAL Ed25519 SIGNATURE, AND WHY THAT IS THE POINT

The domain tag is prepended to the challenge input, BEFORE R and the public key:

    e = wide_reduce(SHA-512(tag || bytes(R) || bytes(A) || m))

Standard Ed25519 computes e = wide_reduce(SHA-512(bytes(R) || bytes(A) || m)).
Because R and A are pinned by the signature and the key, there is no message m'
for which the standard challenge equals ours -- finding one means finding a
SHA-512 collision. So an internal signature is structurally unverifiable outside
this protocol.

Had the tag been placed after, on the message only, the result would have been a
VALID Ed25519 signature over the prefixed message tag || m. That is exactly the
property we do not want here: a PoP or CertEq signature must never be replayable
as an ordinary signature.

NONCE DERIVATION

Standard Ed25519 derives its deterministic nonce from a by-product of the seed,
prefix = SHA-512(seed)[32:]. This protocol has no seeds anywhere -- host keys are
raw scalars -- so that mechanism does not exist for us and the derivation has to
be spelled out. It is keyed by the raw secret scalar instead:

    k = wide_reduce(SHA-512(tag || d_le || aux || m))

Deterministic nonces are safe here because PoP and CertEq are SINGLE-PARTY
signatures; the MPSW18 multi-party attack does not apply. `aux` is optional
extra entropy.

    `aux` MUST be exactly 32 bytes; pass NO_AUX for the purely deterministic
    variant.

    WHY aux IS FIXED-WIDTH -- this refines the spec, which writes the nonce
    input as `tag || d_le || aux || m` with both aux and m variable-length.
    Plain concatenation is not injective, so distinct (aux, m) pairs can produce
    the same byte string and therefore the same k. Two signatures with the same
    R and different messages give different challenges, and the secret key falls
    straight out of d = (s1 - s2) / (e1 - e2). Fixing aux at 32 bytes makes
    d_le || aux exactly 64 bytes, so m is unambiguously the tail and the
    collision is impossible by construction. BIP340 solves the same problem the
    same way, by hashing its aux down to a fixed width first.

    Every point here arrives through GE.from_bytes_compressed, which enforces
    the prime-order subgroup, so the cofactored form would accept exactly the
    same set -- but writing the cofactorless one keeps a single verification
    equation across the whole protocol and matches what Solana enforces for the
    final aggregate signature.

    IDENTITY. A is [d]B with d nonzero and R is [k]B with k nonzero, so neither
    can legitimately be the identity here; an identity means a broken or
    malicious signer. from_bytes_compressed already refuses it, so this function
